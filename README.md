# VSFP Butterfly Code
This repo contains all the main functions (and their dependencies) used for preprocessing and analyzing the VSFP-Butterfly resting state data published here: https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0298-23.2024  

A Description of each function should be available at the top of each file.   

Main preprocessing scripts:  
  For voltage resting state imaging data: _preProcVSFP10L_Final.m_  
  For voltage stimulation data: _preProcStimData_Final.m_  
  For Ephys: _preProcEphys_Final.m_  
  For Behavioral Data:  _face_vidProc_Final.m_  

For the data analysis functions either 1) do analysis to generate one of the main figures or 2) serve as a helper function that gets called by several of the main functions
